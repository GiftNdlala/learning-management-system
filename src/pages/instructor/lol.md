## 🤝 Ownership & Partnership Proposal

Firstly, I want to sincerely thank GRACE ARTISAN SCHOOL for trusting me with this high-impact project and granting me the space to explore, lead, and grow professionally. It has been both an educational and career-defining experience, and I do not take the opportunity for granted.

Although, in line with intellectual property practices and ethical compensation for digital products, I would like to formally propose the following:

### 📜 Intellectual Property Status

> **Statement:** This LMS system was conceptualized, designed, and developed primarily on my personal infrastructure (device, tools, GitHub repository, and private project folders), outside of the institution's hardware or licensed infrastructure.

As such, unless otherwise contractually agreed:

* **100% of the source code, system logic, structure, and all backend/frontend implementations are the intellectual property of the developers involved**, specifically myself (Gift Ndlala) and Siphamandla (co-developer).
* No commercial use, deployment, or institutional integration of this LMS may occur **without express permission or a formal agreement of rights, licensing, or compensation**.

---

### 💼 Partnership / Compensation Proposal

Given the project's strategic importance to G.A.S and the significant value created by two interns under self-motivated conditions, I propose the following options:

#### **Option A: Budgeted Compensation**

A once-off token of appreciation or performance reward that:

* Acknowledges the immersive nature of this development
* Reflects commitment and professional-level deliverables
* Does **not need to match** market project value but shows goodwill

💡 Suggested Range: **R10,000 – R25,000** per developer (Gift & Siphamandla)

#### **Option B: Royalty-based Contract Agreement**

If the LMS will be monetized or used to serve **paying students**, a contract-based royalty system should be agreed upon.

**Proposed Terms:**

* A recurring royalty of **5–10% per paying user or license** that accesses the LMS
* Monthly, quarterly, or per-term tracking and reporting
* Transparent metrics provided by the institution or LMS admin

#### **Option C: Ownership & Use License Agreement**

If GRACE ARTISAN SCHOOL intends to fully own, deploy, or publicly represent this LMS as part of its digital infrastructure:

* A **contract must be signed transferring full rights** to the institution
* In exchange, developers (Gift & Siphamandla) will receive:

  * Written credit and authorship
  * The right to use the LMS in portfolios/case studies
  * Royalty clause (as outlined above) or **negotiated fixed fee**

---

### ⚖️ Summary

This LMS project is a professionally developed system with substantial value. While it was built under an internship, it constitutes original work outside typical intern expectations. Therefore:

> 🤝 A clear, transparent agreement regarding ownership, usage, compensation, and long-term credit should be negotiated between the developers and the institution.

I remain open to continued collaboration, further development, or full system handover — under mutually agreed conditions that respect the value of this solution and the effort invested by both Gift and Siphamandla.

## 🙏 Appreciation & Opportunity

First and foremost, I'd like to thank GRACE ARTISAN SCHOOL for trusting me with this opportunity to develop something of significant value. This project has not only allowed me to grow professionally but has also provided me with the real-world experience of building a scalable, production-ready system under internship conditions.

This LMS was built entirely from scratch, using my own development tools, devices, and hosting services, outside of any pre-existing GAS infrastructure.

---

## 📜 Ownership & Royalty-Based Compensation Proposal

### Intellectual Property Statement

> This LMS system — including all its code, database models, frontend interface, and integrations — was designed and developed on my personal equipment, hosted via personal repositories, and built without institutional development tools or direct financial support.

Unless otherwise contractually agreed upon:

* **Full ownership of the source code remains with the developers involved** — namely, myself (Gift Ndlala) and co-developer **Siphamandla**.
* Any deployment, public release, or operational use of this LMS by GAS or its partners **must be preceded by a signed agreement** detailing licensing terms and compensation.

---

### 🧾 Compensation or Rights Proposal

#### 1️⃣ **Fixed Budgeted Compensation**

A once-off payment to acknowledge and reward the value created by two independent developers.
💡 Suggested: **R25,000 – R50,000** per developer.

#### 2️⃣ **Intellectual Property Agreement**

If the system will be fully owned by GAS, a **formal IP transfer agreement** should be signed outlining:

* Scope of rights
* Developer credit
* Non-exclusive licensing clauses (for use in portfolio or case studies)

#### 3️⃣ **Royalty-Based Remuneration**

If the LMS will be used to onboard **paying students**, we propose a **performance-based royalty agreement**, such as:

* A fee of **R50–R100 per enrolled user**, OR
* **5–10% of LMS-related income or license revenue**

This ensures that the developers are continuously rewarded for ongoing use while aligning our incentives with the institution’s success.

---

## ⚖️ Summary Statement

> I respectfully request a written agreement from GRACE ARTISAN SCHOOL that clarifies ownership rights, deployment intentions, and a fair compensation or royalty structure — either as a fixed payment or as part of a revenue-sharing model.

As a young intern, I am not employed or salaried, yet I’ve built a product that rivals enterprise systems in function and potential. This proposal seeks to ensure fair recognition and sustainable collaboration between independent developers and the institution.
