# Frontend-Backend Connection Configuration

## Problem
The frontend was deployed but still configured to connect to `localhost:8000` instead of the deployed backend on Render.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables Created
- **`.env`** - For development and local testing
- **`.env.production`** - For production builds

Both files contain:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://gas-learning-management-system.onrender.com
```

### 2. Updated API Configuration Files
- **`src/services/api.js`** - Main API configuration (already used environment variable)
- **`src/services/studentApi.js`** - Updated to use environment variable

### 3. Updated All Hardcoded URLs
Updated the following files to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` instead of hardcoded localhost:

- `src/pages/StudentRegistration.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/Assignments.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/ManageAssignments.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/assignments/CreateAssignment.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/assignments/AssignmentDetail.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/InstructorEwallet.js`
- `src/pages/instructor/GradeStudent.js`
- `src/pages/student/StudentDashboard.js`

## Backend Information
- **Backend URL**: https://gas-learning-management-system.onrender.com
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and running on Render
- **Server**: Running with Gunicorn on port 10000

## Next Steps

### For Development Team
1. **Rebuild and Redeploy Frontend**: The frontend needs to be rebuilt with the new environment variables
2. **Test API Connectivity**: Verify that all API endpoints are working with the new configuration
3. **Monitor CORS Settings**: Ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend domain

### For Local Development
The configuration maintains backward compatibility:
- If `REACT_APP_API_URL` is not set, it falls back to `http://localhost:8000`
- Local development will continue to work with local backend

### Deployment Commands
For production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build will automatically use the production environment variables.

## Verification
After redeployment, test these key functionalities:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Student registration
- Module management
- Assignment creation and submission
- Dashboard data loading

## CORS Configuration
Ensure the Django backend's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes the frontend deployment URL.
